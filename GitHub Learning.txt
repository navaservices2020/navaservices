**** Vesion Control System ****
Version control system (VCS) is a software tool that helps in managing changes to source code or any other kind of files. It allows developers to keep track of modifications made to their code over time, collaborate with others, and revert back to previous versions if necessary.

There are two main types of VCS: centralized and distributed. Centralized version control systems, such as CVS and Subversion, store all versions of a file in a central repository. Developers check out files from the repository, modify them, and then check them back in.

Distributed version control systems, such as Git and Mercurial, give each developer a local copy of the entire repository. Developers can make changes to their local copy without affecting the central repository. They can then merge their changes with the central repository, or with other developers' copies of the repository.

Version control systems provide several benefits, including:
1) Collaboration: VCS allows multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously without interfering with each other's changes.
2) History: VCS keeps a history of all changes made to a file, which makes it easy to see who made what changes and when.
3) Rollback: VCS allows developers to revert back to a previous version of a file or the entire project, which is useful in case of errors or mistakes.
4) Branching: VCS allows developers to create branches, which are copies of the codebase that can be worked on independently. This is useful when working on new features or experimenting with changes.

Git pull is a command used in the Git version control system to update a local repository with changes from a remote repository. It combines two other Git commands, git fetch and git merge, into a single command.

When you run "git pull" in your local repository, Git will fetch the changes from the remote repository and merge them into your current branch. This can be useful when you're working with a team and want to update your local copy of the code with changes made by others.

Here's an example of how to use git pull:
1) Navigate to your local repository directory in the command line.
2) Run "git pull" to fetch and merge the changes from the remote repository.
3) If there are conflicts between the changes in the remote and local repositories, Git will prompt you to resolve them.
4) Once the merge is complete, you can continue working on your local copy of the code with the updated changes.

================ Commands ====================
$ git pull --- Fetch the changes from the remote repository
$ cat 'GitHub Learning.txt' --- To see the content of file

------------ git add
'git add' is a command in the Git version control system that adds changes made to a file or directory to the Git staging area. This command allows Git to track the changes that have been made to files and prepares them to be committed.
$ git add [filename]
$ git add .
$ git commit
